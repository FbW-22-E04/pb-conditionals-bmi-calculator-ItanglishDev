//Q1 Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
const markHeight = 178;
const markMass = 76.5;
const johnHeight = 191;
const johnMass = 88;

//Q2 Calculate both their BMIs and store their BMIs in variables.
const markBmi = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBmi = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;

//Q3 Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

//Q4 Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3 using string interpolation. (e.g. "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? Why yes, it's [boolean], it is").

//Q5 Create an *if* statement which prints the name and BMI of the person with the highest BMI.
